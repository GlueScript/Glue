Valid scripts

http://entity.net/thing >> http://service.net/ (GET first uri and POST the response to second uri)
http://entity.net/thing >> http://service.net/ >> http://filter.net/ (GET first uri and POST the response to second uri POST that response to third uri)

<< indicates make a GET request or just use the raw uri as a GET uri command?
>> indicates make a POST request with the body of the previous response (requires a prev request)
>+ indicates make a PUT request with the body of the previous response (requires a prev request)
>- indicates make a DELETE request

Can we support ">> http://service.com" - make a POST with no data/body?

Implement / to mean split the response body (expect a json array)

http://entity.net/thing >> http://dom.net/?f=//a/@href />> http://scrapper.net

GET the first uri and POST its response to dom.net to extract the href attribute values of all a tags, then split the response from this and POST each item to scrapper.net. Respond with the contents of the result of the last request

If a service returns an array of uris can I get each one in the script and do something with its contents?
