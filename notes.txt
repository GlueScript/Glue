Valid scripts

http://entity.net/thing >> http://service.net/ (GET first uri and POST the response to second uri)
http://entity.net/thing >> http://service.net/ >> http://filter.net/ (GET first uri and POST the response to second uri POST that response to third uri)

<< indicates make a GET request or just use the raw uri as a GET uri command?
>> indicates make a POST request with the body of the previous response (requires a prev request)
>+ indicates make a PUT request with the body of the previous response (requires a prev request)
>- indicates make a DELETE request

Can we support ">> http://service.com" - make a POST with no data/body?

Implement / to mean split the response body (expect a json array)

http://entity.net/thing >> http://dom.net/?f=//a/@href />> http://scrapper.net

GET the first uri and POST its response to dom.net split the response from this and POST each item to scrapper.net

If a service returns an array of uris can I GET each one in the script and do something with its contents rather than have a service do this?


Other example uses?? split and join / and +

1) returns an array of uris POST each one to a metadata service which generates metadata for a resource and then collate the results (convert back to an array) and pipe (+>>) into a report
http:/resource.net/?age>100&age<30000 />> http://resource.md.net/ +>> http://resource.report.net/
